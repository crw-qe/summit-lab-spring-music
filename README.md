Red Hat Summit Hands-on Lab
============

The source code from this was adapted from the well-known [Spring Music](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music) sample application.

The application has been refactored to use [Spring Cloud Kubernetes](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-kubernetes) as well as adopting the [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) and [Outbox](https://debezium.io/blog/2020/02/10/event-sourcing-vs-cdc/) patterns.
